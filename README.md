# election-audit-report-database: A database of election audit reports

The goal is to organize information on [evidence-based elections](https://georgetownlawtechreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/4.2-p523-541-Appel-Stark.pdf), collecting, archiving, and
analyzing any and all forms of election auditing in the world.

Please contribute any reports that you run across, and/or reports you write up based on your
own observations.

As the project matures, we'll come up with standardized schemas to describe the audits and how
publicly verifiable they are, etc. Then we'll document each election, and each contest in each election,
in a database to make analysis easier.
